## ADR UK (ECHILD funder)

> make administrative data **more accessible** ... 

Objectives

*  Champion best practice [in] research-ready data, including **publishing** a guide 
to its creation and use.

*  Support the FAIR Guiding Principles *(metadata!)*

*  Encourage researchers to develop and **share** research concepts such as 
derived variables.

*  Encourage researchers to **share** code, **documentation** 
and **feedback**

## GitHub

> Git is version control. GitHub is more, much more:

*  Project management
*  Automation
*  Web hosting (searchable documentation, tutorials, etc.)
*  Issue tracking
*  Discussion boards

## Documentation: A single source of truth

*  Documentation in a single set of text file (a markup language)
    - multiple output formats (pdf, docx, and html)
    - automatically published on the web
    - version controlled (what changed, when, why, who)

**Distributed but centralised**

*  Anyone can access and work on a (public) GitHub project
*  ... but we can impose centralised checks and reviews before accepting changes

## Code sharing

Aim: One centralised collection of all ECHILD analyses, adequately documented 
and citeable

*  <span style="color: #DC3545">TREs: isolated from wider internet</span>
*  Can only export "final" analysis code (*bla_final_really-final_v2.do*)
*  Use templates to encourage adequately documentation of code
*  Automatically use DOIs to enable citation and track use
*  Link to impact: demonstration of *improving patient care* and/or 
*public interest*

*Not perfect but best endeavours*

## Difficulties (1 of 2)

*  Learning:
    - Git 
        - *Web UI*
    - Interacting with GitHub 
        - *Unavoidable!*
    - GitHub Actions
        - *Once set up, should require few mods*
    - Markup languages 
        - *Visual editors*

## Difficulties (2 of 2)

*  Getting people (internal and external) to use it
    - policy, guidance and expectations on sharing code
    - internal training (UCL 
    [DSD](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/learning-teaching/learning-teaching-services/digital-skills-development) 
    and 
    [ARC](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/advanced-research-computing-centre) groups)
    - signposting to external resources
    - tutorials / vignettes
    - templates
        
## Examples

*  Ministry of Justice Analytical Services Platform Team
    - <https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/user-guidance>
*  OpenSAFELY
    - <https://github.com/opensafely>

## Feedback

*  Your thoughts
*  Your input matters

**No system thrives unless it is used!**
