## The ECHILD research database {.smaller}

* Department for Education (DfE) [identity assigned by DfE]:
    + National Pupil Database (NPD): Education and social care records (collated 
    from schools, awarding bodies, local authorities, other social care 
    providers)
* NHS England [identity assigned by NHS E]: Healthcare provided by 
    + Hospitals
    + Community services, inc. maternity services (not Primary Care)
    + Mental health services
* Office for National Statistics [identity assigned by NHS E]: Life-events data
    + Birth registrations
    + Death registrations
* UCL [identities assigned by NHS E]:
    + Mother - child links (derived from hospital delivery records and birth 
    notifications)

Where is UCL in all this?

## Stuck in the middle (wrt evaluation)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
On one side

* Historically NHS England supplied very little linkage (meta)data
* NHS England has limited capacity
* UCL Agreement included "evaluate linkage quality and bias" but __how__ 
not specified
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
On the other:

* Existing (internal) projects wish to understand changes in linkage quality 
and bias
* Unspecified, future projects will wish to understand how their analyses are 
impacted by the linkage
:::

::::

## What ECHILD / HOPE studies wish to evaluate {.smaller}

*  Impact of changes in linkage methods between ECHILD v2 -vs- v1:
    + NHS England's implementation of its Master Patient Service (MPS) - 
    changed how the same patient is identified across NHS E datasets (esp. in 
    the absence of a NHS Number)
    + Demographics from across all NPD tables vs just 1 [spring census] table
    + Increased data coverage (period) and expanded cohort:
        - Period: 1984-09-01 to 2023-03-31 vs 1995-09-01 to 2020-03-31 
        - Cohort: Born 1984-09-01 to 2023-03-31 vs 1995-09-01 to 2020-03-31
*  Case ascertainment and bias within groups (e.g. more recent birth cohorts, 
 children with Down's syndrome)


## How we wish to do this?

Building on GUILD:

*  ~~using a gold standard dataset to quantify false matches and missed 
matches~~ [unavailable]
*  comparing characteristics of linked and unlinked data to identify potential 
sources of bias
*  using sensitivity analyses to evaluate how sensitive results are to changes 
in linkage procedure.

Also: 

*  Ecological level comparisons: comparison with small area census counts by 
demographic characteristics.

## What we require {.smaller}

Linkage sensitivity analyses:

*  Information on the strength of a match (deterministic only) ‚úîÔ∏è

NHS England's change to internal linkage method (MPS)

*  Representative dataset with both old and new (MPS) linkage method applied ‚úîÔ∏è

For eval of impact of using identifiers from all NPD tables & impact of 
increased data coverage and expanded cohort:

*  Information on the distribution of identifiers across NPD tables and their 
individual strength of a match / non-match ‚ùì [TBC]


## Wider Questions

* What linkage (meta)data is currently made available by different state-backed 
linkage providers?

* Beyond GUILD, what linkage (meta)data should routinely be made available by 
state-backed linkage providers?

* Merge-split issues are likely to impact many routine data analyses (whether 
linkage is implicit or explicit). What metadata should we request from all data 
providers to evaluate this?
